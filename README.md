# Refactoring Words

Consider the meaning of each sentence. 

How can we say each in fewer words? 

Refactor each sentance to be more consise, less confusing, or better formatted.

### Example:

```
The cat is purple. The cat is purple and being silly.
```

The purple cat is being silly.

### Exercise:

```
Samus will ride her spaceship from earth to another planet at some time in the future.
```

```
Link and Zelda are the heros of Hyrule.
```

```
Gannon is a beast.
```

```
A teenage boy will smoke his first marijuana cigarette, within an hour he will laugh at the  thought of a horse riding a jockey, instead of the other way around. 
```

```
Everyone on earth will become flesh-eating zombies. When the flesh is all gone, they will be dirt-eating zombies.
```
